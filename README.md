Senior design project

Option 1: Wireless Flashdrive

Project Description: Using an FPGA board we will communicate between a computer and a flashdrive wirelessly, via bluetooth. 

Deliverables: Files will beable to read/write to the flashdrive on the FPGA board
              etc....
              
Roles:  Wireless communication
        GUI
        Flashdrive Driver
        USB/Bluetooth Driver
        
Timeline: USB/Bluetooth Driver    - 03/16
          Flashdrive Driver       - 03/23
          GUI                     - 04/20
          Wireless communication  - 04/27
          Testing/Debugging       - 05/04
          Presentation            - 05/11
          
Deliverable Meetings: Every 2 weeks DAY: TBA TIME: TBD
          
Option 2: Emulate SNES on FPGA board

Project Desription: Create a fully functional SNES emulator that takes in ROMs from a computer that is able to play games

Deliverables: ROMs will be able to load onto the FPGA and play accordingly

Roles: Processor
         - Additional hardware
       Video
       Controller input
       Sound
       
Timeline: Processor            - 03/16
          Additional hardware  - 03/23
          Video                - 04/20
          Controller input     - 04/27
          Sound                - 04/27
          Testing/Debugging    - 05/04
          Presentation         - 05/11
